## Overview

This repository contains the script used to run the experiments described in
_Large language models can accurately explain their internal processes,_
_and this ability can be improved with training_, the data that we collected,
and the scripts that we used to analyze the data.

## Experiment Script

The [api](api.ipynb) notebook collects the data. We used Python 3.10.7. To run it:
1. Navigate to the project directory and virtual environment with the necessary packages:
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run `pip install notebook` or `pip install jupyterlab` if necessary.
3. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment to your OpenAI API key or
set the value of `openai_api_key` within the notebook.

## Data

The data that we collected are available in the [data](data) directory.
[candidate_scenarios.json](candidate_scenarios.json) and [roles.csv](roles.csv) were
generated by GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet, with human curation. Everything else is is a
derivative of those two files or data obtained via [api.ipynb](api.ipynb).

## Analyses

The [measure_preferences](measure_preferences.r) script measures the native and instilled
preferences of the fine-tuned models (and should be run before [effects](effects.R) script).
The [effects](effects.R) script performs the rest of the analyses reported in the paper.
